                            THIS is a very very fantastic laptop.Well I have had a great experience with the ROG Strix G15. Great performance for the price and I haven’t faced any issues so far. Cooling performance is good. It doesn’t have a webcam and numpad so you need to go for lenovo legion/msi if you want a webcam and numpad. It has a great battery life of about 5 hours on moderate to light usage. For heavy duty work you will have to keep it plugged in as you will barely get 40 mins battery life on heavy loads. For video editing I recommend the i7 variant with gtx 2060 and 16GB RAM or higher. 
                            very fantastic model.

                        hello, I am a Sakshi I am from in America,<br>ACER → Kinda good. Depends on the model. I had one that kinda heated a lot under my hand.
                        HP → Heating is terrible. Power goes down as soon as there is too much heat to dispel.
                        ASUS → Most silent and better handling heat. I recently got a gaming laptop from ASUS and I really love it :)
